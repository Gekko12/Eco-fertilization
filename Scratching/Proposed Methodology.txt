In this study, a predictive model for the nutrients required for crops was obtained using random forest and artificial neural network algorithms. First, a variate of random forest, Multivariate Random Forest (MRF, when the number of output features is greater than 1) presents a model. In the following, using the artificial neural network, a model is presented. Then, using a combination of two random forest algorithms and an artificial neural network, a model with acceptable accuracy for the prediction is presented. A total of 7 features have been used to evaluate the above algorithm.

The algorithm requires input from the user (such as location and cropping). The location is fed to the Weather API which will return certain characteristics (e.g. temperature, humidity, rainfall) and if there is a possibility of heavy rainfall, a precautionary message is displayed to the user, otherwise the proposed algorithm is followed.
