The extent to which gray leaf spot damages crop yields can be estimated based on the extent to which leaves are infected relative to grainfill. Damage can be more severe when developing lesions progress past the ear leaf around pollination time.	Because a decrease in functioning leaf area limits photosynthates dedicated towards grainfill, the plant might mobilize more carbohydrates from the stalk to fill kernels.

        <br/>1. In order to best prevent and manage corn grey leaf spot, the overall approach is to reduce the rate of disease growth and expansion.

        <br/><br/>Common corn rust, caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi, is the most frequently occurring of the two primary rust diseases of corn in the U.S., but it rarely causes significant yield losses in Ohio field (dent) corn. Occasionally field corn, particularly in the southern half of the state, does become severely affected when weather conditions favor the development and spread of rust fungus

        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Although rust is frequently found on corn in Ohio, very rarely has there been a need for fungicide applications. This is due to the fact that there are highly resistant field corn hybrids available and most possess some degree of resistance.

        <br/>2. However, popcorn and sweet corn can be quite susceptible. In seasons where considerable rust is present on the lower leaves prior to silking and the weather is unseasonably cool and wet, an early fungicide application may be necessary for effective disease control. Numerous fungicides are available for rust control. """,

        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Management of NCLB can be achieved primarily by using hybrids with resistance, but because resistance may not be complete or may fail, it is advantageous to utilize an integrated approach with different cropping practices and fungicides.

    'Grape___Black_rot': """ <b>Crop</b>: Grape <br/>Disease: Black Rot<br/>
        <br/> Cause of disease:

        <br/><br/> 1. The black rot fungus overwinters in canes, tendrils, and leaves on the grape vine and on the ground. Mummified berries on the ground or those that are still clinging to the vines become the major infection source the following spring.

        <br/> 2. During rain, microscopic spores (ascospores) are shot out of numerous, black fruiting bodies (perithecia) and are carried by air currents to young, expanding leaves. In the presence of moisture, these spores germinate in 36 to 48 hours and eventually penetrate the leaves and fruit stems. 

        <br/> 3. The infection becomes visible after 8 to 25 days. When the weather is wet, spores can be released the entire spring and summer providing continuous infection.


        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Space vines properly and choose a planting site where the vines will be exposed to full sun and good air circulation. Keep the vines off the ground and insure they are properly tied, limiting the amount of time the vines remain wet thus reducing infection.

        <br/>2. Keep the fruit planting and surrounding areas free of weeds and tall grass. This practice will promote lower relative humidity and rapid drying of vines and thereby limit fungal infection.
        
        <br/>3. Use protective fungicide sprays. Pesticides registered to protect the developing new growth include copper, captan, ferbam, mancozeb, maneb, triadimefon, and ziram. Important spraying times are as new shoots are 2 to 4 inches long, and again when they are 10 to 15 inches long, just before bloom, just after bloom, and when the fruit has set.""",

        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Post-infection practices (sanitation and vine surgery) for use in diseased, mature vineyards are not as effective and are far more costly than adopting preventative practices (delayed pruning, double pruning, and applications of pruning-wound protectants) in young vineyards. 


        <br/>2. Sanitation and vine surgery may help maintain yields. In spring, look for dead spurs or for stunted shoots. Later in summer, when there is a reduced chance of rainfall, practice good sanitation by cutting off these cankered portions of the vine beyond the canker, to where wood appears healthy. Then remove diseased, woody debris from the vineyard and destroy it.
        
        <br/>3. The fungicides labeled as pruning-wound protectants, consider using alternative materials, such as a wound sealant with 5 percent boric acid in acrylic paint (Tech-Gro B-Lock), which is effective against Eutypa dieback and Esca, or an essential oil (Safecoat VitiSeal).""",

        <br/> Cause of disease:

        <br/><br/> 1. Leaf mold is caused by the fungus Passalora fulva (previously called Fulvia fulva or Cladosporium fulvum). It is not known to be pathogenic on any plant other than tomato.

        <br/> 2. Leaf spots grow together and turn brown. Leaves wither and die but often remain attached to the plant.
        <br/> 3. Fruit infections start as a smooth black irregular area on the stem end of the fruit. As the disease progresses, the infected area becomes sunken, dry and leathery.
        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Use drip irrigation and avoid watering foliage.

        <br/>2. Space plants to provide good air movement between rows and individual plants.
        
        <br/>3. Stake, string or prune to increase airflow in and around the plant.
        <br/>4. Sterilize stakes, ties, trellises etc. with 10 percent household bleach or commercial sanitizer.
        <br/>5. Circulate air in greenhouses or tunnels with vents and fans and by rolling up high tunnel sides to reduce humidity around plants.
        <br/>6. Keep night temperatures in greenhouses higher than outside temperatures to avoid dew formation on the foliage.
        <br/>7. Remove crop residue at the end of the season. Burn it or bury it away from tomato production areas.""",

        <br/> Cause of disease:

        <br/><br/> Septoria leaf spot is caused by a fungus, Septoria lycopersici. It is one of the most destructive diseases of tomato foliage and is particularly severe in areas where wet, humid weather persists for extended periods.

        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Remove diseased leaves.

        <br/>2. Improve air circulation around the plants.
        
        <br/>3. Mulch around the base of the plants

    'Tomato___Spider_mites Two-spotted_spider_mite': """ <b>Crop</b>: Tomato <br/>Disease: Two-spotted spider mite<br/>
        <br/> Cause of disease:

        <br/><br/> 1. The two-spotted spider mite is the most common mite species that attacks vegetable and fruit crops.

        <br/> 2. They have up to 20 generations per year and are favored by excess nitrogen and dry and dusty conditions.
        <br/> 3. Outbreaks are often caused by the use of broad-spectrum insecticides which interfere with the numerous natural enemies that help to manage mite populations. 
        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Avoid early season, broad-spectrum insecticide applications for other pests.

        <br/>2. Do not over-fertilize
        
        <br/>3. Overhead irrigation or prolonged periods of rain can help reduce populations.""",


    'Tomato___Target_Spo': """ <b>Crop</b>: Tomato <br/>Disease: Target Spot<br/>
        <br/> Cause of disease:

        <br/><br/> 1. The fungus causes plants to lose their leaves; it is a major disease. If infection occurs before the fruit has developed, yields are low.

        <br/> 2. This is a common disease on tomato in Pacific island countries. The disease occurs in the screen house and in the field.
        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Remove a few branches from the lower part of the plants to allow better airflow at the base

        <br/>2. Remove and burn the lower leaves as soon as the disease is seen, especially after the lower fruit trusses have been picked.
        
        <br/>3. Keep plots free from weeds, as some may be hosts of the fungus.
        <br/>4. Do not use overhead irrigation; otherwise, it will create conditions for spore production and infection.""",


    'Tomato___Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus': """ <b>Crop</b>: Tomato <br/>Disease: Yellow Leaf Curl Virus<br/>
        <br/> Cause of disease:

        <br/><br/> 1. TYLCV is transmitted by the insect vector Bemisia tabaci in a persistent-circulative nonpropagative manner. The virus can be efficiently transmitted during the adult stages.

        <br/> 2. This virus transmission has a short acquisition access period of 15–20 minutes, and latent period of 8–24 hours.
        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Currently, the most effective treatments used to control the spread of TYLCV are insecticides and resistant crop varieties.

        <br/>2. The effectiveness of insecticides is not optimal in tropical areas due to whitefly resistance against the insecticides; therefore, insecticides should be alternated or mixed to provide the most effective treatment against virus transmission.
        
        <br/>3. Other methods to control the spread of TYLCV include planting resistant/tolerant lines, crop rotation, and breeding for resistance of TYLCV. As with many other plant viruses, one of the most promising methods to control TYLCV is the production of transgenic tomato plants resistant to TYLCV.""",




    'Tomato___Tomato_mosaic_virus': """ <b>Crop</b>: Tomato <br/>Disease: Mosaic Virus<br/>
        <br/> Cause of disease:

        <br/><br/> 1. Tomato mosaic virus and tobacco mosaic virus can exist for two years in dry soil or leaf debris, but will only persist one month if soil is moist. The viruses can also survive in infected root debris in the soil for up to two years.

        <br/> 2. Seed can be infected and pass the virus to the plant but the disease is usually introduced and spread primarily through human activity. The virus can easily spread between plants on workers' hands, tools, and clothes with normal activities such as plant tying, removing of suckers, and harvest 
        <br/> 3. The virus can even survive the tobacco curing process, and can spread from cigarettes and other tobacco products to plant material handled by workers after a cigarette


        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>


        <br/>1. Purchase transplants only from reputable sources. Ask about the sanitation procedures they use to prevent disease.

        <br/>2. Inspect transplants prior to purchase. Choose only transplants showing no clear symptoms.
        
        <br/>3. Avoid planting in fields where tomato root debris is present, as the virus can survive long-term in roots.
        <br/>4. Wash hands with soap and water before and during the handling of plants to reduce potential spread between plants."""
