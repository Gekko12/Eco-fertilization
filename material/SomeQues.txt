Weather API how you're going to use it?
to get the temp, humidity and rainfall value for the whole week, as user has to input location ie. City and crop name

For how many weeks you predict for heavy rainfall?
probabably for one week, if there is high chance of heavy rainfall we will display an appropriate msg to postpone the fertilizing process to avoid leaching

Why you use Rf rather han DT ?
Random Forest prevents overfitting (which is common in decision trees) by creating random subsets of the features and building smaller trees using these subsets.

[overfitting]
overfitting is "the production of an analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data, and may therefore fail to fit to additional data or predict future observations reliably

Why RF is better than regression ?
The averaging makes a Random Forest better than other ML algo [single Decision Tree] hence improves its accuracy and reduces overfitting


When to use RF ?
when extrapolation outside the training data is not important.

Random forest is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm that is used widely in Classification and Regression problems.
